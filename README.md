- [ ] Add multithreading to interpolation methods (e.g., `polcoe`)  
- [ ] Combine and refactor linear algebra routines for cleaner structure  (In progress)
- [ ] Link library routines internally to reduce redundancy (In progress) 
- [ ] Expand documentation on method usage (Low Prio) 
- [ ] Hypergeometric and Hypergeometric derivatives  
- [x] Random numbers (especially Monte Carlo Methods)

- [x] FFT implementations
- [ ] Manage lib dependencies (In progress)
- [ ] Fourier and Spectral Analysis (Lots of calls from FFT section of lib)
